# Analytics

Understanding your progress is key to long-term habit retention. The Analytics module provides visual insights into your performance.

## Statistics

Users can view detailed statistics about their habits:
*   **Completion Rate:** Percentage of rituals completed vs. scheduled.
*   **Streak History:** Visual representation of current and longest streaks.
*   **Activity Heatmap:** A calendar view showing daily activity intensity (similar to GitHub contributions).

## Progress Tracking

*   **Level Progress:** Visual bar showing how much XP is needed for the next level.
*   **Badge Collection:** A showcase of all earned and locked badges.

## Data Privacy

All statistical data is private to the user, unless they explicitly choose to share specific achievements or their leaderboard position with friends.
