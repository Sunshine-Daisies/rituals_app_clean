# Social & Community

Building habits is easier when you're not alone. The Rituals App includes social features to foster accountability and competition.

## Friends System

Users can build their social circle within the app.
*   **Add Friends:** Search for users by username and send friend requests.
*   **Friend List:** View all connected friends.
*   **Activity Feed:** (Planned) See when friends complete their rituals or earn badges.

## Ritual Partnerships

This is a core feature for accountability.
*   **Sharing:** A user can "share" a specific ritual with a friend.
*   **Joining:** The friend receives an invite code or link to join the ritual.
*   **Co-op Tracking:** Once joined, both users track the same ritual instance.
*   **Nudges:** If a partner hasn't completed their ritual by a certain time, you can send a "Nudge" (a friendly push notification).

## Leaderboards

Compete with friends and the global community.
*   **Global Leaderboard:** Top users based on total XP.
*   **Friends Leaderboard:** Ranking among your added friends.
*   **Weekly/Monthly:** (Planned) Time-based leaderboards to keep the competition fresh.
